            <h3>Incident Overview</h3>
            <p>
                On the early morning of **February 3, 2025**, two commercial aircraft were hijacked by members of the extremist group 
                **Crimson Resolve**. At **5:45 AM**, the first aircraft, a Hollnliada Aircharter A320, crashed into the 
                **Aberian National Assembly** building, resulting in its complete destruction and the loss of **700+ government officials, staff, and civilians**.
            </p>
            <p>
                At **6:15 AM**, the second aircraft, an Aberian Airlines Boeing 777-200LR, struck the headquarters of the 
                **Department of Counterterrorism and National Intelligence (DCNI)**. This attack decimated the nation’s counterterrorism leadership, 
                killing over **300 key personnel**, including top intelligence officers.

            <h3>Timeline of Events</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>4:00 AM:</strong> Both aircraft departed from Hollnliada International Airport under routine conditions.</li>

                <li><strong>6:15 AM:</strong> The second aircraft crashed into the DCNI headquarters, resulting in catastrophic damage.</li>
                <li><strong>6:30 AM:</strong> Emergency response teams began evacuations and rescue efforts at both sites.</li>

            <h3>Immediate Impact</h3>
            <p>
                The attacks resulted in over **1,000 fatalities** and left Aberliada’s government infrastructure in disarray. 
                The destruction of the DCNI headquarters crippled national counterterrorism efforts, leaving the nation vulnerable to further attacks.

                <li><strong>February 4, 2025:</strong> Supreme Chancellor David Evans declared the **Global War on Terror (GWOT)**, vowing to eradicate extremist groups worldwide.</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Strategic Implications</h3>
            <p>
                The Hollnliada Attacks marked a turning point in Aberian foreign policy. The immediate militarization and global reach of the GWOT 
                solidified Aberliada’s role as a dominant military power. The use of extreme measures, including nuclear readiness, 
                set a precedent for aggressive counterterrorism strategies.
